## Dependencies

- deno
- [fdupes](https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes)
- Obtain a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and place its contents in `secrets/github-pat.txt`


## Updating set of releases

```sh
bin/update.sh
```

The quarto releases are placed in `releases/v...`, so `releases/v1.4.68/bin/quarto` will run Quarto 1.4.68.

The `releases` folder is deduplicated using `fdupes`, and so you can store a relatively large number of versions with relatively little storage space. 
I have ~400 quarto versions on my laptop and it takes a total of 22GB (as opposed to 273GB or so it would take if they were not de-duped).

## Using

I set up a bash script `qv` and place it in my path. In my specific case, that's:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

version=$1
shift

~/repos/github/cscheid/quarto-regress/releases/v${version}/bin/quarto $*
```

From there, you can, for example,

```sh

qv 1.4.68 render file.qmd
```

If you want to download releases older than 1.4, edit `fetch-releases.ts` around lines 24-28.
